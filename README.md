# Raw Aim

Like in speedrunning a run is only accepted if a VOD of the run linked in the submition.
Kovaak's does not have this feature. When someone cheats and does not get cought by the Anti-Cheat their run is accepted. Some known and trusted members of this community wished for a mandetory VOD to be submitted in higher ranks. This is the idea behind Raw Aim.

I am using this project to learn TypeScript, Astro, React and how to Work with Databases.
The fact that there are people in this community that wish for something like this is motivationg. The reason for that is, that this project primarily meant to gain more knowledge, will be used by a lot of people if it is good enough.
